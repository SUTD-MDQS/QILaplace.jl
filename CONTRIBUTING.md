# Contributing to QILaplace.jl

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute (I appreciate you reading this file)! 🫰🏻

## A note from the maintainer

Yes—please don’t hesitate to contribute and help further develop this project.

This repository is maintained by a sleep-deprived PhD student who learned open-source development by starring popular Julia packages, reading forum threads, and watching YouTube tutorials. If parts of the codebase seem unpolished or unclear, please feel free to help me out.

## How to contribute

Pull requests for refactors, documentation, performance improvements, or new ideas are very welcome. If you make the project better, you are a contributor. Here's a quick guide on how to get started:

1. **Fork the repository** and create your branch from `master`.
2. **Implement your changes**. If you're adding a feature, please add tests.
3. **Run the tests** locally using `julia --project=. test/runtests.jl`.
4. **Submit a pull request**. 

We appreciate any help, whether it's fixing a typo or implementing a new tensor-network algorithm!
